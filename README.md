# Portfolio 🚀

Welcome! 👋  
  
I'm Roland, and this space documents my programming journey.  
I'm currently exploring embedded systems and data analysis. 💻

Here, you'll find projects, code snippets, and learning notes as I progress.
Learning is a lifelong process, and I'm happy to share my progress.  

Feel free to browse and connect! 😊
