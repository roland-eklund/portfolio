# Portfolio  🚀

Welcome! 👋 I'm Roland, and this space is a collection of my programming journey. 

I'm currently learning embedded systems and data analysis.💻
Expect to find projects, code snippets, and notes as I learn and explore and build things.

🗂️ Everything is organised in folders in this repo.

Learning is a lifelong process, and I'm excited to share my progress here. 
Feel free to browse and connect! 😊
