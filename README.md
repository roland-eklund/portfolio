# Portfolio 🚀

Welcome! 👋 I'm Roland, and this space documents my programming journey.

I'm currently exploring embedded systems and data analysis. 💻

Here, you'll find projects, code snippets, and learning notes as I progress.

🗂️ Folders organize everything in this repo.

Learning is a lifelong process, and I'm happy to share my progress. Feel free to browse and connect! 😊
